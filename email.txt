This is with regard to your nomination for the Young Faculty Recognition Award (YFRA) 2019.

 

On behalf of the Young Faculty Recognition Award Committee appointed by the Director, I would like to invite you to kindly make a 10 minutes presentation (using about 10 slides if you wish to use power point presentation) which will be followed by discussions of the significant aspects and features of your teaching and research contributions before the Committee on 22nd  August 2019 (Thursday) at 5.00 p.m. The venue for the presentation will be the Conference room, IV Floor, Administration Building.

 

I would like to apprise you of what the Committee seeks to learn from you. What we would appreciate is hearing from you, in your own words, the significance of your engagement with teaching and research, the vision and motivating spirit that inspired it, your perspective on it, how you feel it fits into your over-all academic goals and objectives, and why you feel it merits special recognition. Please feel free to express yourself spontaneously and informally. The members of the Committee would be happy to get a sense of the `special' nature of your particular achievement(s), conveyed to them directly by yourself.
